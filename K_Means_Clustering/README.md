# K-Means Clustering

This README file provides information on K-Means Clustering and its implementation. K-Means is an iterative algorithm that determines centroids and assigns points to clusters based on their proximity to the centroids. Below is a breakdown of the content covered in this README.

<a name="part-a"></a>
## Part A: K Means Clustering
In this section, the K Means Clustering algorithm is introduced. The `make_blobs` function from `sklearn.datasets` is used to generate a synthetic dataset for demonstration purposes.

<a name="part-b"></a>
## Part B: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
This section discusses the process of performing exploratory data analysis on the generated dataset.

<a name="part-c"></a>
## Part C: Plotting Scatter Plot for the Data
A scatter plot is created to visualize the generated dataset.

<a name="part-d"></a>
## Part D: Implementing K-Means
The K-Means algorithm is implemented using the `KMeans` class from `sklearn.cluster`. The cluster centers, labels, and number of iterations are displayed.

<a name="part-e"></a>
## Part E: Testing Different Values of K
In this section, the K-Means algorithm is tested for different values of K. The cluster centers, labels, and number of iterations are displayed.

<a name="part-f"></a>
## Part F: Elbow Method for Determining Optimum Number of Clusters
The elbow method is applied to determine the optimum number of clusters for the dataset. The sum of squared distances from each point to its centroid is plotted against the number of clusters.

<a name="conclusion"></a>
## Conclusion
Based on the elbow curve, the optimum number of clusters is determined.

<a name="part-g"></a>
## Part G: Implementing K-Means on the Iris Dataset
K-Means is implemented on the Iris dataset, similar to the previous sections. The results are visualized using a scatter plot.

Use the provided instructions and code examples to explore and understand the implementation of K-Means Clustering.
