# Decision Trees

This README file provides information on Decision Trees and their implementation. Decision Trees are supervised machine learning algorithms used for classification and regression tasks. They partition the feature space into segments based on feature values and make predictions by following the learned decision rules. Below is a breakdown of the content covered in this README.

## Part A: Decision Trees
This section introduces Decision Trees and their role in machine learning. It also mentions the dataset used for the subsequent analysis.

<a name="part-b"></a>
## Part B: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The EDA section focuses on exploring the dataset. It may include tasks such as data visualization, understanding the distribution of features, identifying missing values, etc.

<a name="part-c"></a>
## Part C: Label Encoding
In this section, categorical features are encoded into numerical values to prepare the dataset for training a Decision Tree classifier.

<a name="part-d"></a>
## Part D: Decision Tree Classifier
The DecisionTreeClassifier from the `sklearn.tree` module is used to build a Decision Tree model. Two different criteria, "gini" and "entropy," are applied to compare the performance. The decision trees are visualized using the `tree.plot_tree` function.

<a name="part-e"></a>
## Part E: Comparison with Another Dataset
Another dataset, "diabetes_1," is loaded and subjected to the same operations as described in the previous sections. The performance and accuracy of the Decision Tree classifier with different criteria are compared.

<a name="conclusion"></a>
## Conclusion
The conclusion section provides a summary of the results obtained from the analysis. Based on the results, it states which criterion (Gini or Entropy) performs better for the given dataset.

This README provides a comprehensive overview of Decision Trees, their implementation, and the analysis performed on the provided dataset. Follow the sections in order to understand the concepts, explore the data, and evaluate the performance of the Decision Tree classifier.
