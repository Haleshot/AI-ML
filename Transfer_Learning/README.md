## Introduction
This README provides a structured guide for implementing Transfer Learning with the VGG 16 model. Transfer learning allows us to leverage pre-trained models like VGG 16, which is trained on large-scale image datasets like ImageNet, and adapt them for specific tasks with relatively smaller datasets.

## Steps

### Step 1: Explore the VGG 16 model and the data it is trained on
Explore the architecture and details of the VGG 16 model, as well as the ImageNet dataset it is trained on.

### Step 2: Load the VGG 16 model in your notebook and print the summary of the model

#### Step 2a: Load an image from file and pre-process it
Load an image from a file, preprocess it according to the requirements of the VGG 16 model (e.g., resize, normalization), and prepare it for inference.

#### Step 2b: Predict the class of the image using VGG 16
Apply the pre-trained VGG 16 model to predict the class label of the loaded image.

### Step 3: Load a few images in your notebook and predict the class
Load multiple images into your notebook, preprocess them similarly, and predict their class labels using the pre-trained VGG 16 model.

### Step 4: Explore how to remove the last layer of the VGG model
Investigate methods to remove the last layer of the VGG 16 model, which is typically the softmax layer for class prediction, in order to adapt it for other tasks.

### Step 5: Add a few layers to the VGG 16 model
Extend the VGG 16 model by adding additional layers (e.g., dense layers) to modify its architecture for specific requirements.

### Step 6: Add binary classification data and compile the model
Integrate binary classification data with the modified VGG 16 model and compile it with appropriate loss function, optimizer, and metrics.

### Step 7: Train the new model for binary classification of images
Train the modified VGG 16 model using the binary classification data, and evaluate its performance.

### Step 8: Define the layers which are trainable
Specify which layers of the modified VGG 16 model are trainable during the training process, and which layers are frozen to retain pre-learned features.
