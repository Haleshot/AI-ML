A.1
Aim: 
a. Implement a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) in Python for the following problem
Find all (x,y) where x ‚àà {1,2,3} and 0 <= y < 10, and x + y >= 5
b. For 4-Queen problem and Sudoku -
i. Identify the variables in the above problem
ii. Identify set of constraint variables
iii. Identify domain each variable

A.2
Prerequisite: Basic understanding of constraint satisfaction problem

A.3
Learning Outcome:
After completing this experiment, you will be able to-
1. Formulate a CSP
2. Implement a small problem with constraints in Python

A.4
Theory:
A.4.1 Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP)
ÔÇ® CSP can be defined by set of three components- X,D,C
ÔÇ§ X is set of variables {ùëã1
, ùëã2 ‚Ä¶ . ùëãùëõ
}
ÔÇ§ D is a set of domains {ùê∑1
, ùê∑2
, ‚Ä¶ ùê∑ùëõ
} for each variable
ÔÇ§ C is a set of constraints that specify allowable combination of values



A.4.2 Example-
ÔÇ§ If ùëã1 ùëéùëõùëë ùëã2 have the same domain {1,2,3} then the constraint saying that 
ùëã1 > ùëã2 can be written as
‚óº ‚ü®(ùëã1, ùëã2), {(3,1), (3,2), (2,1)}‚ü© or ‚ü®(ùëã1, ùëã2), ùëã1 > ùëã2‚ü©
