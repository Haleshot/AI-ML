## Aim
### Text Classification
- Implement Text Classification using information retrieval methods.
- Analyze, comprehend, and compare the techniques used.

## Prerequisite
- Python

## Outcome
After successful completion of this experiment, students will be able to:
1. Understand the concept of Information Retrieval and its application in text classification.

## Theory
Text classification is a machine learning technique that assigns a set of predefined categories to open-ended text. It is fundamental in natural language processing with applications such as sentiment analysis, topic labeling, spam detection, and intent detection. Automatic text classification leverages machine learning, NLP, and AI techniques to classify text efficiently and accurately.

### Machine Learning Text Classification Algorithms
- Naive Bayes
- Support Vector Machines
- Deep Learning (Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN))

## Task to be completed in PART B
### Task
1. Select a dataset of your choice or use the dataset from [News Category Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rmisra/news-category-dataset).
2. Apply at least two different techniques/algorithms for classifying the text in the given dataset to develop a model.
3. Predict the class of the test dataset using the developed models.
4. Analyze, comprehend, and compare results using appropriate metrics.
