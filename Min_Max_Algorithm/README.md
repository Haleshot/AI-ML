A.1 Aim: 
a. To design a simple game using Min Max algorithm in Python

A.2
Prerequisite: Basic understanding of search algorithms

A.3 
Learning Outcome:
After completing this experiment, you will be able to:
1. Implement a simple search problem using Min Max algorithm

A.4 Theory:
A.4.1 Adversarial Search
The competitive environments, in which the agents’ goals are in conflict, give rise to adversarial 
search problems—often known as games.

A.4.2 Min Max Algorithm
 It is a search algorithm that finds the best move for MAX by
 trying all actions and 
 choosing the actions whose resulting state has the highest MINIMAX value
 It is a recursive algorithm that proceeds all the way down to the leaves of the tree
 Then backs up the minimax values through the tree as the recursion unwinds.
