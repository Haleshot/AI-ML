## Aim
The aim of this project is to design a simple game using the Min Max algorithm in Python.

## Prerequisite
A basic understanding of search algorithms is required to work on this project.

## Learning Outcome
After completing this experiment, you will be able to:
1. Implement a simple search problem using the Min Max algorithm.

## Theory
### Adversarial Search
Adversarial search problems arise in competitive environments where the goals of agents are in conflict. These problems are often referred to as games.

### Min Max Algorithm
The Min Max algorithm is a search algorithm that helps find the best move for the MAX player. It achieves this by trying all possible actions and choosing the action that leads to the state with the highest MINIMAX value. The algorithm works recursively, exploring all the way down to the leaves of the game tree and then backtracking to propagate the minimax values.
