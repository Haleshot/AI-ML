## Introduction
This README provides a structured guide for implementing Stock Market Prediction using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks. LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that is well-suited for time series prediction tasks like stock market forecasting.

## Steps

### Step 1: Load the dataset in the notebook
Load the stock market dataset into your notebook for further analysis and model building.

### Step 2: Select the appropriate feature for creating the model from the training data
Identify and select the relevant features from the dataset that will be used as input to train the LSTM model.

### Step 3: Normalize the features and convert it into time stamps of 60
Normalize the selected features to ensure uniformity in scale and convert them into time stamps of 60 for sequential processing.

### Step 4: Reshape the data (3 D array) for applying to the LSTM model
Prepare the data by reshaping it into a 3-dimensional array suitable for inputting into the LSTM model.

### Step 5: Create a sequential LSTM model using Keras
Design and configure a sequential LSTM model using the Keras API, defining the architecture of the neural network.

### Step 6: Compile the model and train it using the training data
Compile the LSTM model with appropriate loss function, optimizer, and metrics, and train it using the preprocessed training data.

### Step 7: Predict using the test data
Utilize the trained LSTM model to make predictions on the test dataset and evaluate its performance in stock market prediction.
