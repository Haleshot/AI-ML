## Aim
The aim of this project is to develop intelligent agents using Simple Linear Regression on real-world datasets to:
- Predict brain weight (grams) when head size (cm3) is known.
- Predict price (Rs) when home size (Sq. Ft) is known.

## Introduction to Regression
Regression is a mathematical approach used in AI to find the relationship between two or more variables. It is widely used in machine learning to predict the behavior of one variable based on the value of another variable.

## Linear Regression
Linear regression is a type of regression used to find a linear relationship between a target variable and one or more predictors. It assumes a linear relationship between the input variables (x) and the single output variable (y). The goal is to find the best-fit line that minimizes the difference between the predicted and actual values.

## Types of Linear Regression
There are two types of linear regression:
1. Simple Linear Regression: It is used when there is a single input variable (x).
2. Multiple Linear Regression: It is used when there are multiple input variables.

## Linear Equation Representation
In simple linear regression, the relationship between the input variable (x) and the output variable (y) is represented by the linear equation:
y = B0 + B1*x

In multiple linear regression, the line is represented as a plane or hyperplane in higher dimensions. The equation takes the form of the linear equation, with additional coefficients for each input variable.
