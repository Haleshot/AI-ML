# DBSCAN Clustering Algorithm

This README file provides information on the DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) algorithm and its implementation. DBSCAN is a density-based clustering algorithm that groups together data points that are close to each other in dense regions and identifies outliers as points in low-density regions. Below is a breakdown of the content covered in this README.

## Part A: DBSCAN Clustering Algorithm
In this section, the DBSCAN algorithm is introduced. The `make_blobs` function from `sklearn.datasets` is used to generate a synthetic dataset for demonstration purposes.

<a name="part-b"></a>
## Part B: Implementing DBSCAN
The DBSCAN algorithm is implemented using the `DBSCAN` class from `sklearn.cluster`. The `eps` (epsilon) and `min_samples` parameters are set to define the clustering behavior.

<a name="part-c"></a>
## Part C: Handling Outliers
This section discusses how DBSCAN identifies outliers as noise points. The outliers are plotted separately to visualize their presence in the dataset.

<a name="part-d"></a>
## Part D: Exploring Different Parameters
The impact of changing the `eps` and `min_samples` parameters on the DBSCAN algorithm is explored. The dataset is visualized with different parameter values to observe the clustering behavior and outlier detection.

<a name="part-e"></a>
## Part E: DBSCAN on Circular Dataset
DBSCAN is applied to a circular dataset generated using the `make_circles` function from `sklearn.datasets`. The resulting clusters are visualized with different colors.

<a name="part-f"></a>
## Part F: DBSCAN on Moon-shaped Dataset
DBSCAN is applied to a moon-shaped dataset generated using the `make_moons` function from `sklearn.datasets`. The resulting clusters are visualized with different colors.

<a name="part-g"></a>
## Part G: DBSCAN on Diabetes Dataset
The DBSCAN algorithm is applied to the diabetes dataset. The steps performed in the previous sections are repeated on this dataset, showcasing how DBSCAN can be used in a real-world scenario.

In this README, you will find code examples, visualizations, and explanations of the DBSCAN algorithm and its application to different datasets. Follow the provided instructions and explore the implementation of DBSCAN for clustering and outlier detection purposes.
