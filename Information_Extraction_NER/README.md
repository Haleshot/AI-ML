## Aim
### Information Extraction-POS tagging and NER
- Identify Part of Speech such as Noun, Verb, Adjective, Adverb and tag it.
- Identify named entity in the text for Named Entity Recognition.

## Prerequisite
- Python

## Outcome
After successful completion of this experiment, students will be able to:
1. Explore various methods to tag the POS and identify the named entity.
2. Apply the above concepts on datasets to create features for ML/DL models.

## Theory
### POS Tagging
POS tagging is the process of assigning one of the parts of speech to each word in a sentence. Parts of speech include nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, pronouns, conjunctions, and their sub-categories.

### Named Entity Recognition (NER)
Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a method in NLP that extracts important information from text, categorizing entities such as names, locations, companies, events, products, dates, monetary values, and percentages. It is crucial for various NLP applications including chatbots, sentiment analysis, and search engines.

### Information Extraction Architecture

## Task to be completed in PART B
### Task
#### A.5.1. Task
- Implement POS tagging and identify Named Entity in the given text using:
  i. NLTK
  ii. Spacy
- Select a dataset from real-world examples (e.g., reviews of firms/products/books/hotels) and perform the following tasks:
  i. Remove noise (stopwords, punctuation) from predictor columns.
  ii. Create features such as total word length, number of unique words, number of bigrams.
  iii. Create features for POS tags and named entity tags.
