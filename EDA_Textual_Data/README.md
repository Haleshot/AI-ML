## Aim
### Exploratory data analysis of textual data
- To obtain most frequent words distribution, average chapter length, most frequent phrases (bi, tri and quadgrams), names of characters, places, and events for any two books/novel.
- To interpret findings through word-clouds, bar plots and histograms.
- To perform EDA on some available textual dataset.

## Prerequisite
- Python

## Outcome
After successful completion of this experiment, students will be able to:
1. Explore, analyse and interpret the textual data.
2. Establish a precursor for sentiment analysis.

## Theory
### Exploratory Data Analysis of Textual Data
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the process of exploring data, generating insights, testing hypotheses, checking assumptions, and revealing underlying hidden patterns in the data. Textual data requires similar EDA techniques where we can describe the data using summary statistics, plot charts like histograms and heatmaps, calculate term frequencies, extract n-grams (bi, tri, and quadgrams), and visualize them using word-clouds, bar plots, and histograms. 

### Performing EDA
To perform EDA on textual data, we can use libraries like pandas for data description, seaborn or plotly for plotting, nltk for extracting n-grams, and matplotlib or plotly for visualizations. Various tasks include obtaining word distributions, average chapter lengths, extracting frequent phrases, and identifying entities like characters, places, and events.

## Task to be completed in PART B
### Task
#### A.5.1. Task
- To access two books or novels and perform the following tasks:
  i. Obtain most frequent words distribution.
  ii. Calculate average chapter length.
  iii. Extract most frequent phrases (bi, tri, and quadgrams), names of characters, and places.
- To select a dataset from real-world examples (e.g., reviews of firms/products/books/hotels) and perform the following tasks:
  i. Read the dataset in CSV or Excel format.
  ii. Understand the dataset and formulate a problem statement.
  iii. Perform EDA on the dataset.
