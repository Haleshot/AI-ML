A.1 Aim: 
To find shortest path from the starting node to a goal node using Best First search algorithm with Python.

A.2Prerequisite: Basic understanding of search algorithms.

A.3 Learning Outcome:
After completing this experiment, you will be able to
1. Understand Significance of Heuristic function
2. Implement Best First Search Algorithm to find the shortest path

A.4 Theory:

A.4.1 Heuristic function
A heuristic in the most common sense is a method involving adapting the approach to a 
problem based on previous solutions to similar problems. Approaches aim to be easily and 
quickly applicable to a range of problems.
Basic idea of heuristic search is- Rather than trying all possible search paths at each step, try 
to find which paths seem to be getting us nearer to our goal state.
Heuristic function is used in informed search to find the most promising path. It takes current 
state of the agent as input and finds how close the agent is from the goal state. Does not always 
give the best solution, but finds a good solution in a reasonable time. It is represented by ‚Ñé(ùëõ).
